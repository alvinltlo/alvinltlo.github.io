## Summary

Planning a comprehensive budget is crucial when purchasing property in Japan, especially for non-residents, who are nearly impossible to get a loan from banks in Japan. The total cost extends far beyond the property price itself, including various taxes, fees, and ongoing expenses that must be carefully calculated.

Beside the property cost, these are additional expenses that you need to consider.  They totaled around **5%-8%** of the property cost.
